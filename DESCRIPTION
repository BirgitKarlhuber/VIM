Description: This package introduces new tools for the visualization of
        missing and/or imputed values, which can be used for exploring the
        data and the structure of the missing and/or imputed values. Depending on
        this structure of the missing values, the corresponding methods 
        may help to identify the mechanism generating the
        missing values and allows to explore the data including missing values. 
        In addition, the quality of imputation can be visually explored using various
        univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate plot methods.
        A graphical user interface available in the separate package VIMGUI allows an easy handling of
        the implemented plot methods.
